# Camera Mouse

Use a webcam to control the mouse. Small demo which tracks movement in the camera's video output and uses the right-most point of movement as position inside the video frame. This can be translated to the screen position to control the mouse pointer.

## Usage

Install GTK3 development `gtk3-devel` and `clang` packages first, they are required for the build.

Run `cargo run`.
