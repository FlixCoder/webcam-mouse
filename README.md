# Camera Mouse

Remaster of small demo from many years ago, which tracks movement in the camera's video output and uses the right-most point of movement as position inside the video frame. This could be translated to the screen position to control the mouse pointer.

## Usage

Install GTK3 development `gtk3-devel` and `clang` packages first, they are required for the build.

Run `cargo run --release`.
